                After working with record label's across the network on a
                session basis. Ricky and Matt found avenues to explore more for
                independent bands and artists. We specialise in artist
                management, Artist development, Promotions, Distribution and
                Music Licensing.

                While working with booking agents and personalised P.R.
                Campaigns for individual, we can look at support slots,
                collaborated supports, and also help with business plans help
                with touring in the future.

                Right now the professional arena is completely crowded and has
                been for many years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Honestly without huge budgets or being able to compete on a
                professional level its kind of non existent, as consumers have
                more access to free music.
            </p>
            <p>
                We noticed a gap in the market after we followed a lot of other
                artist and bands, whilst we were on the road in other bands
                working hard.
            </p>
            <p>
                We understand that strategy needs to change for independent
                bands and artists. Doing the same thing and expecting to see
                different results can change today...
